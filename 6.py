# The list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate the sum of the numbers
total_sum = sum(numbers)

# Calculate the count of the numbers (how many there are)
count = len(numbers)

# Calculate the average
average = total_sum / count

# Display the results
print(f"The numbers are: {numbers}")
print(f"The sum is: {total_sum}")
print(f"The count is: {count}")
print(f"The average is: **{average}**")
