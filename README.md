# Python Practice Programs 🚀

This repository contains a structured collection of **Python programs** designed for absolute beginners.  
The goal is to learn Python programming by solving small problems daily and maintaining a **consistent GitHub streak**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn Python from the basics (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Improve problem-solving and logic building
- Push daily code to build consistency + GitHub streak
- Keep programs small, clean, and well-structured
